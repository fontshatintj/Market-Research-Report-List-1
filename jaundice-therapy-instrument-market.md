<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Jaundice Therapy Instrument Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Phototherapy</li><li>Fiberoptic Phototherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The jaundice therapy instrument market includes various treatment options for neonatal jaundice. Conventional phototherapy involves the use of fluorescent lights to emit blue light, which helps break down excess bilirubin in the infant's blood. Fiberoptic phototherapy, on the other hand, employs a flexible fiberoptic blanket that delivers light directly to the skin, providing a more localized treatment. Both methods aim to reduce bilirubin levels effectively, but fiberoptic therapy is often preferred for its portability and ease of use in home settings.</p></p>
