<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyester Geogrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biaxial Tension</li><li>Uniaxial Tension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Polyester Geogrid market comprises two main types: biaxial tension and uniaxial tension. Biaxial tension geogrids are designed to provide strength and stability in both horizontal and vertical directions, making them ideal for applications like pavement reinforcement and soil stabilization. Uniaxial tension geogrids, on the other hand, are engineered to withstand loads primarily in one direction, which is beneficial for retaining walls and slope stabilization. Both types enhance structural integrity and extend the lifespan of civil engineering projects.</p></p>
