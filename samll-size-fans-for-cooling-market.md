<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Samll Size Fans for Cooling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Centrifugal Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Small size fans for cooling are classified into two main types: axial fans and centrifugal fans. Axial fans move air along the axis of the fan, providing efficient airflow with minimal resistance, making them suitable for cooling in compact spaces. In contrast, centrifugal fans draw air inward and expel it at right angles, generating higher pressure and airflow, ideal for applications requiring more robust air movement. Both types serve diverse industries, enhancing thermal management and equipment cooling.</p></p>
